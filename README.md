## About me

Hi, I'm High Programmer. You might be wondering why my profile is not filled with codes and projects written off the substances which you've seen or heard somewhere. I may not have a lot of code to show you in front, because most of these projects I've made OR worked on are'nt  very open sourced, or licensing issues and etc. 

BUT, I promise there's a lot to expect. I am very sure you're familiar with the AI traffic coming out now, Good news is i can't wait to show you guys some of the projects i been working on. Stick around with me from now till end 2025.

## sPOILERs
I updated my knowledge base from just python to some other stuff, So for spoliers, code wont just be written in Python. Expect them in this order or out of order. Who cares :)
